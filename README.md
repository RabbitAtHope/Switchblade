////

A collection of small, useful Bash shell scripts for Linux server maintenance and sysadmin work, particularly Ubuntu Linux LTS servers. Designed to give a one-click point-and-shoot for tedious and repetitive tasks.

## ⚙️ Usage notes
- Most of these scripts work best with Ubuntu LTS server installations, but many will have error-catching options and alternative commands or file location checks for other distributions.
- If necessary, you may need to install the <b>dos2unix</b> library with apt or your preferred package manager to convert the scripts from Windows to Linux line endings.
- If you want to add pretty colors to your own scripts, [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5947742/how-to-change-the-output-color-of-echo-in-linux) is helpful.
